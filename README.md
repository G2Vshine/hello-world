Ideas, learning tools, and dreams

I live in Northwest Ohio. I'm a 42yo single mom of 2 phenomenal teenage boys. Recently, I had a virtual reality experience that prompted me to make a career change. So, now, I'm currently in the process of learning to code and attending a VR developing class. This (GitHub) is one of the steps I am taking on my journey.
